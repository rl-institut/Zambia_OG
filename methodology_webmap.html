    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> The provided webmap is based on leaflet. Three different basemaps are displayed as external resources. All overlayed information is hosted locally. The solar irradiation layer was created in QGIS using the QTiles plugin. Settlements were converted from GeoJSON to vector tiles using tippecanoe. All vector tiles are hosted using tileserver-gl. Vector styles and filters are implemented directly in JavaScript. The download link, in the selection detail view, uses the overpass-api to download OpenStreetMap buildings directly from the OSM-database. All buildings within the bounding box of the selected settlement are downloaded in OpenStreetMap's xml format. </p>
